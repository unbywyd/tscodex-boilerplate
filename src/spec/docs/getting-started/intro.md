# Introduction

MVP Generator is a file-driven documentation portal and prototype system.

## What is it?

A system that allows teams to document their MVP ideas using simple files and automatically generates a browsable documentation portal with a working React prototype.

## Key Concepts

- **Layers** - Structured TOML files defining guards, roles, routes, etc.
- **Docs** - Markdown documentation (you're reading one now)
- **Prototype** - Working React components linked to documentation
