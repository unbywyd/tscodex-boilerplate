# Mobile Development

## Stack Options
- React Native + Expo
- Flutter
- Native (Swift/Kotlin)

## Considerations
- Touch-first interactions
- Bottom navigation preferred
- Pull-to-refresh patterns
- Offline support

## Layout Patterns
- Stack navigation
- Tab navigation
- Drawer navigation

## Screen Types
- List screens (scrollable)
- Detail screens
- Form screens
- Modal screens

## Entities Adaptation
Same entities from `layers/entities/` apply. Consider:
- Offline sync fields (syncedAt, localId)
- Optimistic updates
- Pagination for lists

## Auth
- Secure token storage (Keychain/Keystore)
- Biometric authentication
- Session management

## Prototype Notes
For mobile prototype:
1. Define screens in `layers/routes/` with `platform = "mobile"`
2. Use mobile-specific guards if needed
3. Consider reduced feature set for MVP

## From Spec to Mobile
```
entities/*.toml → Models
routes/*.toml → Screens
use-cases/*.toml → User flows
guards/*.toml → Auth gates
```
