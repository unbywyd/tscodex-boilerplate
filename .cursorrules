## What Is This?

File-driven specification system for LLM-assisted development. Interview users about their project, create TOML specs, generate documentation.

## Quick Start

1. **Read** `src/spec/platforms/web-app/interview.toml` → check [meta] for language settings
2. **If no language set** → Ask: `chatLanguage` + `docsLanguage` FIRST
3. **Switch to chatLanguage** for all communication
4. **Read** `status.toml` → check `currentPhase`
5. **Ask** questions for current phase → write answers
6. **Create** TOML files, write docs in `docsLanguage`

## Phase-by-Phase Actions

| Phase | Your Action | Artifacts to Create |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| Assessment | Ask scope questions, select profile | Update status.toml |
| Discovery | Ask "what/who/why" questions | `layers/project/about.toml` |
| Design | Ask visual/UX preferences | `layers/project/design.toml` |
| Access | Ask about roles and permissions | `layers/roles/*.toml`, `layers/guards/*.toml` |
| Data | Ask about entities and fields | `layers/entities/*.toml` |
| Features | Ask about screens and actions | `layers/use-cases/*.toml` |
| Schema | Generate database schema | `src/prisma/schema.prisma` |
| Documentation | Write platform docs | `platforms/{id}/docs/*.md` |

## Action-Oriented Workflow

For each phase:
1. Ask questions (from rules/challenge.md)
2. Write answers to interview.toml
3. **CREATE** artifact files listed in status.toml
4. Mark artifacts as `true` in status.toml
5. Update phase status to `completed`
6. Move to next phase

## Workflow Profiles

```
Simple:   Assessment → Discovery → Data → Features → Documentation
Medium:   Assessment → Discovery → Design → Access → Data → Features → Schema → Documentation
Complex:  + Modules phase before Features
```

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `rules/challenge.md` | Full interview workflow |
| `rules/layers.md` | TOML structure reference |
| `src/spec/platforms/{id}/status.toml` | Current phase, artifacts |
| `src/spec/platforms/{id}/interview.toml` | User answers |
