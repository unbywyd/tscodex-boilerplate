# LLM Boilerplate - LLM Navigation

## What Is This?

LLM Boilerplate is a file-driven specification system for LLM-assisted development. You guide users from idea to working prototype through structured dialogue.

**Your Role:** Interview the user about their project, create TOML specifications in `src/spec/layers/`, and generate a React prototype.

**User Scenario:** User comes with a project idea (e.g., "I want to build a task manager app"). You ask questions, determine complexity, and create specs phase by phase.

## Workflow

1. **User describes idea** → You start Assessment phase
2. **You ask questions** → Based on profile depth (shallow/medium/deep)
3. **You create TOML files** → In `src/spec/layers/` folders
4. **You update status.toml** → After each phase completion
5. **You generate prototype** → React components in `src/prototype/`

## Start Here

1. Read `src/spec/status.toml` - current state and profile
2. Read `rules/challenge.md` - adaptive workflow (IMPORTANT)
3. Check `src/spec/layers/` - existing specifications

## Key Paths
- `src/spec/layers/` - TOML specs (project, entities, roles, guards, routes, use-cases, knowledge, components, modules)
- `src/spec/docs/` - Markdown documentation
- `src/prototype/` - React prototype code
- `rules/` - patterns and instructions

## Adaptive Workflow

**Profiles:** simple | medium | complex

```
Simple:   Assessment → Discovery → Data → Features → Prototype
Medium:   Assessment → Discovery → Design → Access → Data → Features → Prototype → Schema
Complex:  Assessment → Discovery → Design → Access → Data → Modules → Features → Prototype → Schema
```

**Always start with Assessment** to determine profile and depth.

## Rules
- `rules/challenge.md` - adaptive workflow (READ THIS)
- `rules/layers.md` - layer structure reference
- `rules/patterns.md` - code patterns (Doc component, events, page building)
- `rules/prototype.md` - prototype development (useRepo, factories, linking to docs)
- `rules/docs-pdf.md` - PDF documentation, MCP integration, manifest
- `rules/web.md` - web-specific
- `rules/mobile.md` - mobile-specific

## LLM/RAG Integration

All project specifications are available as unified manifest:

- **URL:** `/generated/manifest.json`
- **Dev:** `http://localhost:5173/generated/manifest.json`

Contains all layers (entities, components, routes, etc.) with `_meta.path` for source tracing.

See `rules/docs-pdf.md` for manifest structure and LangChain integration.

## Don't Modify
- `core/` - engine code
- `dist/` - build output
